# Hypothesis-Testing-on-Health-Care-Drug-Safety
Conducting several hypothesis tests using Python to determine if the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant as well as checking if factors such as age significantly influence the adverse reactions.

Pharmaceutical drugs have become an essential part of our health. Therefore, they need to be safe with little or no adverse effects.
In this project the main task is to conduct several hypothesis tests using Python to determine if the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant. 
I will also check if factors such as age significantly influence the adverse reactions.

**Approach:**
1. Conduct a two-sample Z-test to determine if the proportion of adverse effects differs significantly between the Drug and Placebo groups and Rounding off the results to three decimal places.
2. Using the appropriate Chi-square test to determine if the number of adverse effects is independent of the groups. Extracting the pearson row from the result's test statistics.
3. Using a histogram to look at the distribution of age in the Drug and Placebo groups.
4. Use the obtained distributions to choose an appropriate statistical test that allows one to determine if there is a significant difference between the ages of the Drug and Placebo groups.

**Inference:**
The obtained P-value guides us to conclude that the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant and age significantly influence the adverse reactions.
